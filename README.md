since youâ€™ve shown me your WeatherForecastController, UserController, and the Program.cs, letâ€™s connect the dots and describe the workflow of your ASP.NET Core Web API step by step.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Application Startup (Program.cs)

When you run the application:

WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args) â†’ bootstraps the app.

Loads config, logging, environment (Development, Production), dependency injection container.

Services are registered:

AddControllers() â†’ enables MVC controllers.

AddEndpointsApiExplorer() + AddSwaggerGen() â†’ enables Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation/testing.

Build app:

var app = builder.Build();


Middleware pipeline is configured:

If Development â†’ enable Swagger + SwaggerUI.

Else (e.g., Production) â†’ enable HTTPS redirection.

Routes are mapped:

app.MapControllers();


This makes all [ApiController] classes available as HTTP endpoints.

App starts listening:

app.Run();

ðŸ”¹ 2. Incoming Request (Routing)

When a client makes an HTTP request, for example:

GET https://localhost:5001/User/GetUsers/hello


ASP.NET Core runs through this workflow:

The request enters the middleware pipeline configured in Program.cs.

If in development, Swagger is available.

If in production, HTTPS redirection may happen.

The request hits Routing Middleware, which looks at the route template defined in your controllers.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Controller Execution
(A) UserController
[ApiController]
[Route("Controller")]
public class UserController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("GetUsers/{testValue}")]
    public string[] GetUsers(string testValue)
    {
        string[] responseArray = new[] { "test1", "test2", testValue };
        return responseArray;
    }
}


Route is /Controller/GetUsers/{testValue} (because [Route("Controller")] is literal).

Example:

GET /Controller/GetUsers/hello


Framework automatically binds hello to parameter testValue.

Method executes and returns an array:

["test1", "test2", "hello"]

(B) WeatherForecastController
[ApiController]
[Route("Controller")]
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("", Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
    public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> GetFiveDayForecast()
    {
        var forecast = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index =>
            new WeatherForecast(
                DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(index)),
                Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
                _summaries[Random.Shared.Next(_summaries.Length)]
            )
        ).ToArray();

        return forecast;
    }
}


Route is /Controller (again because of [Route("Controller")]).

Example:

GET /Controller


Response is a JSON array of 5 random weather forecasts:

[
  { "date": "2025-08-30", "temperatureC": 23, "summary": "Mild", "temperatureF": 73 },
  { "date": "2025-08-31", "temperatureC": -5, "summary": "Freezing", "temperatureF": 23 }
]

ðŸ”¹ 4. Response Returned

Controller methods return CLR objects (string[] or WeatherForecast[]).

The framework automatically serializes them to JSON before sending back to the client.

Client sees JSON, not C# objects.

âœ… Workflow Summary

Program.cs boots app â†’ registers services â†’ sets up middleware â†’ maps controllers â†’ starts server.

Client sends HTTP request â†’ passes through middleware pipeline.

Routing system matches the request URL with a controller action.

Model binding automatically provides method parameters from route/query/body.

Controller action executes and returns a C# object.

ASP.NET Core serializes object â†’ JSON response to client.

âš¡ Right now both controllers are using [Route("Controller")], so they clash (same base path). Thatâ€™s why both UserController and WeatherForecastController endpoints are under /Controller.
